<h3> Hi, this website is the Project!</h3>


<p>This project was my own Personal website. I built this out of pure interest in web development while also wanting to have an online portfolio that others could view. This website gets updated on a weekly/monthly basis, as time permits and as new content is due to be added. Overall the website is a projection of my personality and accomplishments in the past few years and I hope you enjoy it.</p>

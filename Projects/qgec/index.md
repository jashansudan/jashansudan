<h2>Hi! This Project can be viewed <a class = "qgeclink" href = "http://www.qgec.ca"><strong> here </strong></a></h2>

<p>This is the qgec.ca website built for Queen's Global Energy Conference. I made this website to help attract sponsors, speakers and delegates for the 2016 Global Energy Conference held by Queen's University. Another inspiration for building this website was to get myself more familiar with web devlopment and working with different frameworks.</p>

<p> Qgec.ca was built using a bootstrap template, while then adding my own css, js and html for every section I added on. It taught me a lot about servers, domains and formatting websites for different screen resolutions. A lot of issues were faced, for example a big issue that was faced was that the mobile version wasn't scaling properly, and ended up with all sections being smaller than intended, except for the jumbotron. The problem that had occured was that one of the sections hadn't properly embedded the column display of bootstrap and that resulted in more columns being put in the section then were intended. This was fixed, by readjusting the columns, but it took time to pinpoint the source of this error.</p>
